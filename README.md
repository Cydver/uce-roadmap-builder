# Cydver's Pull Roadmap Builder

A desktop-first, browser-based roadmap editor for **Gundam U.C. Engage**. The Builder combines pull-priority tiers, release timing, paired MS/Pilots, strategic tags, investment targets, notes, and longitudinal PVP Meta timelines in one editable roadmap.

The application is static HTML/CSS/JavaScript and is designed to run cleanly from a normal static web host such as GitHub Pages.

## Current feature set

### Roadmap and pull-priority layout

- Editable pull-priority rows with configurable labels and colors.
- Default rows: **Human Rights**, **Must Pull**, **Ideally Pull**, **Luxury Pull**, and **Skip**.
- Units can sit directly inside a tier or between adjacent tiers.
- Between-tier placement automatically reserves clearance when PVP Meta bars cross the same release area.
- Editable month headers with 4- or 5-week months and support for up to 12 months.
- Draggable roadmap cards and meta segments.
- Zoom controls with adaptive grid/text rendering.

Tier labels use geometry-aware abbreviation rather than a fixed zoom breakpoint. Full labels stay visible while they fit in the left rail and abbreviate only when necessary.

### MS and Pilot editing

MS entries support:

- PVP Notes
- PVE Notes
- Minimum Potential (`P0`–`P5`)
- Ideal Potential (`P0`–`P5`)
- strategic tags
- multiple PVP Meta segments
- MS/Pilot pairing

Pilot entries use a single Notes field and can be paired with an MS in the roadmap.

The standard tag set is:

`PVP`, `PVE`, `Must P5`, `Buff`, `Core`, `Tech`, `Def`, `Sub`, `CB`

Custom tags are also supported. `Must P5` and `Buff` use distinctive MS-card border/glow treatments for quick visual identification.

### PVP Meta timeline

PVP Meta is represented as a longitudinal state timeline rather than a numeric rating or strength graph.

Default statuses are:

- Human Rights
- Era-Defining
- Strong
- Rotational
- Situational

Status labels, descriptions, and colors are editable from the Builder legend.

Meta timeline behavior includes:

- multiple status segments per MS
- draggable segments and resize handles
- genuine empty gaps when weeks are unassigned
- transition connectors only between contiguous segments
- contrast-aware text based on the configured status color
- adaptive labels that move from `MS Name - Status` → `MS Name` → no text as rendered space decreases
- a subtle ownership tether from the MS card to its timeline
- tether/node color based on the MS's first chronological PVP Meta status
- linked hover/focus emphasis between an MS card and its complete timeline

The Builder's Meta Status legend is explicitly **PVP only**.

### Adaptive roadmap-card density

At normal zoom, roadmap cards show:

- artwork
- tags
- unit/pilot name

As the roadmap is zoomed out, presentation is progressively simplified according to actual rendered geometry:

1. artwork + tags + name
2. artwork + tags
3. artwork only

Tags have priority over the name at reduced zoom. The name appears only when there is comfortable spacing below the tag stack. Extremely zoomed-out cards remain clickable/draggable even when reduced to artwork only.

### Compact preview and Full Profile

Hovering a roadmap unit shows a compact preview. Clicking opens the centered **Full Profile**.

Builder interaction is split:

- single click → Full Profile after the short click/double-click intent window
- double-click → Selected Unit editor

Full Profile supports:

- paired MS/Pilot presentation
- MS investment values
- PVP Meta history
- Pilot Notes
- MS PVP/PVE Notes
- previous/next MS navigation in roadmap order
- viewport-bounded adaptive height based on measured rendered content
- close by backdrop, close button, or Escape
- app-native tooltips for meta descriptions, tag descriptions, and contextual information

Long MS notes use a constrained preview and can open into the dedicated Full Notes reader when actual overflow is detected.

### Altema integration

Catalog entries include their Altema detail-page `sourceUrl` when available.

For MS Full Profile, the Builder resolves the Altema reference using the following priority:

1. valid roadmap `sourceUrl`
2. exact catalog icon match
3. unique same-kind catalog name match

The resulting external-reference icon opens the MS detail page in a new tab. Pilot-side profile links are intentionally omitted to keep the Pilot panel uncluttered.

## Editing workflow

The main Builder controls are grouped by purpose:

- **+ Blank Unit** — primary creation action
- **Export JSON** — save the current editable roadmap
- **Export PNG** — create a static roadmap snapshot
- **Import JSON** — restore or continue an exported roadmap
- **Save Local** — explicitly save the current roadmap in browser storage
- **Clear Local** — destructive local reset

The catalog sidebar includes a unified **All / MS / Pilots** segmented filter.

Useful editing interactions:

- drag a card to change its week/tier position
- drag near a tier boundary to place a unit between rows
- drag PVP Meta bars to move them
- drag bar handles to resize segments
- right-click cards/bars for context actions
- click a month header to rename it
- right-click a month header to insert/delete months or change its week count
- click a tier header to rename/recolor it
- click a PVP Meta status in the Builder legend to edit its label, description, or color

## Autosave behavior

The Builder keeps a local browser copy of the roadmap.

The Selected Unit popup deliberately does **not** rebuild and save the whole roadmap on every keystroke. Changes remain inside the editor while typing and are committed/rendered/saved once when the popup closes, including Close, backdrop close, or Escape.

This avoids caret jumps and unnecessary synchronous storage/render work during editing.

## Performance architecture

The current Builder includes several optimizations for large roadmaps:

- cached tier/week/card/meta geometry per render state
- precomputed week boundaries and wide-week layout
- batched semantic-zoom DOM reads/writes to avoid layout thrashing
- indexed MS/Pilot pairing and Full Profile navigation lookups
- reused roadmap `<img>` elements across internal rerenders when artwork is unchanged
- asynchronous roadmap-image decoding hints
- targeted Full Profile artwork warming on pointer-down
- tooltip positioning calculated on target entry rather than every pointer movement
- localized ownership-highlight updates
- a single overlay for inactive-meta dimming instead of restyling every unrelated timeline element
- catalog loading that does not block the initial Builder render
- normal/revalidated browser caching for static catalog/roadmap resources

The Builder remains more dynamic than the public Viewer because editing, drag/drop, normalization, and local saves can change the roadmap at any time.

## Catalog maintenance

The Altema catalog updater is incremental. Routine runs reuse existing local icons and download artwork only for new cards or missing files unless a full icon refresh is explicitly requested.

The scraper also keeps a partial-scrape safety check so a suspiciously incomplete scrape does not silently replace a healthy existing catalog.

Useful npm commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run scrape-altema
npm run apply-canonical-names
npm run test-canonical-names
npm run update-catalog
```

`npm run update-catalog` performs the normal combined workflow:

1. scrape the current Altema MS/Pilot lists
2. reuse existing local icons where possible
3. capture Altema detail-page URLs
4. apply the verified canonical-name map
5. generate the unresolved-name review queue

The included GitHub Actions workflow can run the same update automatically or manually from the Actions tab.

## Canonical-name workflow

The catalog intentionally does **not** use automatic fuzzy matching, translation APIs, Game8 naming automation, Gundam Wiki crawling, or AI inside GitHub Actions.

The maintained workflow is:

1. scrape Altema
2. apply the verified canonical-name map
3. keep unresolved names in Japanese
4. generate the unresolved-name review queue
5. manually research unresolved entries
6. update the canonical-name map with verified UCE naming

This keeps canonical names deliberate and reviewable instead of allowing automated fuzzy/translation guesses into the catalog.

## Running locally

Because catalog and roadmap resources are loaded with `fetch()`, serving the folder through a small local HTTP server is more reliable than opening `index.html` directly as a `file://` URL.

For example:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/
```

Any normal static development server works as well.
